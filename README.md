# DownloadCleanup
I built this to get back into Python and i got annoyed at my Downloads-folder being overflown all the time.<br>
If you would like to change/delete/add folders make sure they exist.<br>
Since the program is supposed to run in the background 24/7 there is no code to automatically create folders.
